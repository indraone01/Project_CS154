# Project_CS154
# Cryptographic Security and Hacking Fundamentals
This project is implemented in a functional programming language called Racket \\
In this project I have implemented Some encryption-decryption techniques \\

1) Caesar Shift Cipher \\
2) Scytale Cipher \\
3) Vigin√®re Cipher \\
4) One-Time-Pad Cipher \\
5) Enigma Cipher \\
6) Advanced Encryption Standard (A.E.S.) \\

These are the various methods encryption and decryption functions.\\
apart from it A Hacker function which deciphers scytale and caesar-shift encrypted text \\
read project report for more details.
